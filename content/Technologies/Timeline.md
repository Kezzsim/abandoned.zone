*abandoned.ai* relies on two different types of technology in order to facilitate its mission:
- **Capturing Methods**
	- [[#(1) Photography (1822)|Photography]]
	- [[#(2) Photogrammetry (1867)|Photogrammetry]]
- **Rendering Methods**
	- [[#(3) Structure from Motion (1976)|Structure from motion]]
	- [[#(4) NeRF (2022)|NeRF]]
	- [[#(5) Gaussian Splatting (2023)|Gaussian Splatting]]

On occasion the boundaries between these resource areas can become obfuscated as different software and hardware applications package them together to create a finished product. This article serves to be a broad overview of how these technologies came about and why they're all pertinent to the current zeitgeist enabling the existence of *abandoned.ai*.

# (1) Photography (1822)
#### Method : Capture

A technology as old as time, yet still a crucial part of the process when creating digital places. Many different types of cameras exist in various different configurations, some better than others when it comes to spatial reconstruction. There are 360Â° cameras that can grab entire environments in one go, there are automated pan and tilt cameras that can scan rooms on their own. For guidelines see the section : [[Photography]]

# (2) Photogrammetry (1867)
#### Method : Capture
