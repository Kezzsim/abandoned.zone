Persons performing field work for digital preservation will need to be trained, not strictly in matters of the technology they are creating imagery for but also for personal safety.
Regardless of PPE and Autonomous Platform usage there exists a need to know about the various occupational hazards that exist while working.

These include but are not restricted to:
- Dark environments with limited visibility
- Exposure to different types of friable asbestos
- Potential contact with sharpened rusty metal objects
- fall hazards (Open elevator shafts and sub flooring)
- Falling debris
- Loud infrasound during high winds

# provided training

abandoned.ai will seek to provide remote and in person classes to train staff in the best ways to collect images for photogrammetric processes. This training will be specific to the conditions that exist within buildings with many spaces that lack sufficient illumination. Trainees will be taught how to properly light spaces using battery powered sources such that adequate features can be extracted and turned into geometry.

This will go over at a high level how the process works but will not focus on the data science aspects of processing the imagery or serving it for online access.

> [!tip] Upon completing this training, individuals will receive a certificate and be eligible to become one of the *Spiders*, members of our image capture team.

# External training

New York state among other entities provides training to become certified in asbestos abatement, a task that often involves working in similar environments.

Training courses are offered periodically in several different locations around the state, predominantly Long Island City, Bethpage, Buffalo, Batavia and Albany. [Here is the current schedule](https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/asbestos/course.htm).
