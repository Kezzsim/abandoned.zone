## Prologue

The invention of photography first allowed humans to capture small windows into the world around them, frozen in time to the exact moment the when the shutter opened. For almost a century things remained more or less unchanged aside from incremental improvements to cameras and film processes. Yet when computers started to become an essential part of image processing, suddenly a whole new world of possibilities started to open up. Now, with enough data we can start to truly capture the essence of entire spaces in a way that allows them to persist in a meaningful way that transcends ephemeral physicality.
