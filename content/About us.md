[*abandoned.ai*](https://abandoned.ai) came into existence as a response to the *master plan* drafted by [New York State office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation](https://parks.ny.gov/) towards the end of 2021. The *master plan* which was finalized in late 2023 calls for the gradual destruction of a large collection of abandoned buildings on the north shore of Long Island in the southeastern corner of New York State. While other entities like [Preserve KPPC](https://linktr.ee/preservekppc) emerged with the goal of protecting as much of the present grounds as possible, abandoned.ai stands initially as a *plan b* in the event that their noble goals fail to save the unique spaces inside of each extant structure. 

Regardless of our origins, we seek to become a diverse group with broad knowledge relating to computer science, urban exploration, arts and culture.

### Kari Kay Barry

Currently a full time employee of Brookhaven National Laboratory at the [National Synchrotron Light Source II](https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/). Previously Kari worked for Stony Brook University's Media Lab, [TLL](https://it.stonybrook.edu/services/teaching-learning-lab) where she learned how to preserve a wide variety of physical media using software. She proposed and spearheaded an effort to [digitally capture and preserve the Student Union](https://sbutltmedia.github.io/unionProject/) building on campus which was demolished in 2017 using the aforementioned techniques. Kari is incredibly curious, easily distracted, but very capable when it comes to software engineering. She can often be encountered riding her electric unicycle around Port Jefferson, New York.
