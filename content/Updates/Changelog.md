# Latest release

## Version 0.1.1
#### 01/03/2023
- Add compression for mobile clients and Quest VR using [Splat-converter](https://splat-converter.glitch.me/)
- A-frame has been overwriting our favicon so a `"image/x-icon"` tag was added.
- [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) analytics telemetry was added to all sites.

## Version 0.1.0 ðŸŽ‰
#### 12/27/2023
- Switch from rendering scenes using a modified version of [Antimater15's Gaussian Splatting webGL code](https://github.com/antimatter15/splat) to using a version ported to [A-frame](https://aframe.io/). This brings additional benefits from incorporating [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and WebGL 2.0. All code is now sourced from this [A-frame Gaussian Splatting repository](https://github.com/quadjr/aframe-gaussian-splatting).
- Change code hosting from [a fork](https://github.com/Kezzsim/abandoned_splat_demo) to a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/Kezzsim/abndn-frame).
- Added orbit controls as the default view controller, this locks the viewer into encircling the scanned object in each scene which is more natural than WASD.
- Added VR Component: Although it runs very poorly on Meta Quest Headsets, when attached to a computer scenes are now viewable in Virtual Reality with a full range of motion.
