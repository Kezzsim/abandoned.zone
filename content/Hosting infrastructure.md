#### (Also a short link that redirects to the main site for convenient sharing)
A highly available, distributed collection of `.ply` and `.splat` files ready to be downloaded by abandoned.ai client pages over the public internet. Hosted files may be decimated or otherwise compressed to make them easier to cache and serve, ideally when abandoned.ai partners with physical museums they will feature their own on site infrastructure for streaming of lossless 3D files.
